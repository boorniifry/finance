                    <li style="font-size: 40px; color: black; font-weight: 300;">Buy the right investment</li>
                    <p>
                        Buying the right stock is so much easier said than done. Anyone can see a stock that’s performed
                        well in the past, but anticipating the performance of a stock in the future is much more
                        difficult. If you want to succeed by investing in individual stocks, you have to be prepared to
                        do a lot of work to analyze a company and manage the investment.

                        “When you start looking at statistics you’ve got to remember that the professionals are looking
                        at each and every one of those companies with much more rigor than you can probably do as an
                        individual, so it’s a very difficult game for the individual to win over time,” says Dan Keady,
                        CFP, chief financial planning strategist at TIAA.

                        If you’re analyzing a company, you’ll want to look at a company’s fundamentals – earnings per
                        share (EPS) or a price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), for example. But you’ll have to do so much
                        more: analyze the company’s management team, evaluate its competitive advantages, study its
                        financials, including its balance sheet and income statement. Even these items are just the
                        start.


                        Keady says going out and buying stock in your favorite product or company isn’t the right way to
                        go about investing. Also, don’t put too much faith in past performance because it’s no guarantee
                        of the future.

                        You’ll have to study the company and anticipate what’s coming next, a tough job in good times.

                    <li style="font-size: 40px; color: black; font-weight: 300;">Avoid individual stocks if you’re a beginner</li>
                    <p>
                        Everyone has heard someone talk about a big stock win or a great stock pick.

                        “What they forget about is that often they’re not talking about those particular investments
                        that they
                        also own that did very, very poorly over time,” Keady says. “So sometimes people have an
                        unrealistic
                        expectation about the kind of returns that they can make in the stock market. And sometimes they
                        confuse
                        luck with skill. You can get lucky sometimes picking an individual stock. It’s hard to be lucky
                        over
                        time and avoid those big downturns also.”

                        Remember, to make money consistently in individual stocks, you need to know something that the
                        forward-looking market isn’t already pricing into the stock price. Keep in mind that for every
                        seller in
                        the market, there’s a buyer for those same shares who’s equally sure they will profit.

                        “There are tons of smart people doing this for a living, and if you’re a novice, the likelihood
                        of you
                        outperforming that is not very good,” says Tony Madsen, CFP, founder of NewLeaf Financial
                        Guidance in
                        Redwood Falls, Minnesota.

                        An alternative to individual stocks is an index fund, which can be either a mutual fund or an
                        exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds hold dozens or even hundreds of stocks. And each share
                        you
                        purchase of a fund owns all the companies included in the index.

                        Unlike stock, mutual funds and ETFs may have annual fees, though some funds are free.

                    <li style="font-size: 40px; color: black; font-weight: 300;">Create a diversified portfolio</li>
                    <p>
                        One of the key advantages of an index fund is that you immediately have a range of stocks in the
                        fund.
                        For example, if you own a broadly diversified fund based on the S&P 500, you’ll own stocks in
                        hundreds
                        of companies across many different industries. But you could also buy a narrowly diversified
                        fund
                        focused on one or two industries.

                        Diversification is important because it reduces the risk of any one stock in the portfolio
                        hurting the
                        overall performance very much, and that actually improves your overall returns. In contrast, if
                        you’re
                        buying only one individual stock, you really do have all your eggs in one basket.

                        The easiest way to create a broad portfolio is by buying an ETF or a mutual fund. The products
                        have
                        diversification built into them, and you don’t have to do any analysis of the companies held in
                        the
                        index fund.

                        “It may not be the most exciting, but it’s a great way to start,” Keady says. “And again, it
                        gets you
                        out of thinking that you’re gonna be so smart, that you’re going to be able to pick the stocks
                        that are
                        going to go up, won’t go down and know when to get in and out of them.”

                        When it comes to diversification, that doesn’t just mean many different stocks. It also means
                        investments that are spread among different industries – since stock in similar sectors may move
                        in a
                        similar direction for the same reason.
                    </p>

                    <li style="font-size: 40px; color: black; font-weight: 300;">Be prepared for a downturn</li>
                    <p>
                        The hardest issue for most investors is stomaching a loss in their investments. And because the
                        stock
                        market can fluctuate, you will have losses occur from time to time. You’ll have to steel
                        yourself to
                        handle these losses, or you’ll be apt to buy high and sell low during a panic.

                        As long as you diversify your portfolio, any single stock that you own shouldn’t have too much
                        of an
                        impact on your overall return. If it does, buying individual stocks might not be the right
                        choice for
                        you. Even index funds will fluctuate, so you can’t get rid of all of your risk, try how you
                        might.

                        “Anytime the market changes we have this propensity to try to pull back or to second guess our
                        willingness to be in,” says NewLeaf’s Madsen.

                        That’s why it’s important to prepare yourself for downturns that could come out of nowhere, as
                        one did
                        in 2020. You need to ride out short-term volatility to get attractive long-term returns.

                        In investing, you need to know that it’s possible to lose money, since stocks don’t have
                        principal
                        guarantees. If you’re looking for a guaranteed return, perhaps a high-yield CD might be better.

                        The concept of market volatility can be difficult for new and even experienced investors to
                        understand,
                        cautions Keady.

                        “One of the interesting things is people will see the market’s volatile because the market’s
                        going
                        down,” Keady says. “Of course, when it’s going up it’s also volatile – at least from a
                        statistical
                        standpoint – it’s moving all over the place. So it’s important for people to say that the
                        volatility
                        that they’re seeing on the upside, they’ll also see on the downside.”

                    <li style="font-size: 40px; color: black; font-weight: 300;">Try a simulator before investing real money</li>
                    <p>
                        One way to enter the world of investing without taking risk is to use a stock simulator. Using
                        an online
                        trading account with virtual dollars won’t put your real money at risk. You’ll also be able to
                        determine
                        how you would react if this really were your money that you gained or lost.

                        “That can be really helpful because it can help people overcome the belief that they’re smarter
                        than the
                        market, that they can always pick the best stocks, always buy and sell in the market at the
                        right time,”
                        Keady says.

                        Asking yourself why you’re investing can help determine if investing in stocks is for you.

                        “If their thought is that they’re going to somehow outperform the market, pick all the best
                        stocks,
                        maybe it’s a good idea to try some type of simulator or watch some stocks and see if you could
                        actually
                        do it,” Keady says. “Then if you’re more serious about investing over time, then I think you’re
                        much
                        better off – almost all of us, including myself – to have a diversified portfolio such as
                        provided by
                        mutual funds or exchange traded funds.”

                    <p>
                        Keady says investing should be a long-term activity. He also says you should divorce yourself
                        from the
                        daily news cycle.

                        By skipping the daily financial news, you’ll be able to develop patience, which you’ll need if
                        you want
                        to stay in the investing game for the long term. It’s also useful to look at your portfolio
                        infrequently, so that you don’t become too unnerved or too elated. These are great tips for
                        beginners
                        who have yet to manage their emotions when investing.

                        “Some of the news cycle, at times it becomes 100 percent negative and it can become overwhelming
                        for
                        people,” Keady says.

                        One strategy for beginners is to set up a calendar and predetermine when you’ll be evaluating
                        your
                        portfolio. Sticking to this guideline will prevent you from selling out of a stock during some
                        volatility – or not getting the full benefit of a well-performing investment, Keady says.

                    <li style="font-size: 40px; color: black; font-weight: 300;">Start now</li>
                    <p>
                        Choosing the perfect opportunity to jump in and invest in the stock market typically doesn’t
                        work well.
                        Nobody knows with 100 percent certainty the best time to get in. And investing is meant to be a
                        long-term activity. There is no perfect time to start.

                        “One of the core points with investing is not just to think about it, but to get started,” Keady
                        says.
                        “And start now. Because if you invest now, and often over time, that compounding is the thing
                        that can
                        really drive your results. If you want to invest, it’s very important to actually get started
                        and have …
                        an ongoing savings program, so that we can reach our goals over time.”
                    </p>

                    <li style="font-size: 40px; color: black; font-weight: 300;">Avoid short-term trading</li>
                    <p>
                        Understanding whether you’re investing for the long-term future or the short term can also help
                        determine your strategy – and whether you should be investing at all. Sometimes short-term
                        investors can
                        have unrealistic expectations about growing their money. And research shows that most short-term
                        investors, such as day traders, lose money. You’re competing against high-powered investors and
                        well-programmed computers that may better understand the market.

                        New investors need to be aware that buying and selling stocks frequently can get expensive. It
                        can
                        create taxes and other fees, even if a broker’s headline trading commission is zero.

                        If you’re investing for the short term, you risk not having your money when you need it.

                        “When I’m advising clients … anything under a couple of years, even sometimes three years out,
                        I’m
                        hesitant to take too much market risk with those dollars,” Madsen says.

                        Depending on your financial goals, a savings account, money market account or a short-term CD
                        may be
                        better options for short-term money. Experts often advise investors that they should invest in
                        the stock
                        market only if they can keep the money invested for at least three to five years. Money that you
                        need
                        for a specific purpose in the next couple years should probably be invested in low-risk
                        investments,
                        such as a high-yield savings account or a high-yield CD.

                    <li style="font-size: 40px; color: black; font-weight: 300;">Keep investing over time</li>
                    <p>
                        It can be easy to dump your money into the market and think you’re done. But those who build
                        real wealth
                        do so over time, by adding money to their investments. That means having a strong saving
                        discipline –
                        holding back some of your paycheck – so that you can put it to work in the stock market. You’ll
                        be able
                        to put more money to work and grow your wealth even faster.

                        You may already be doing this if you have a 401(k) retirement account, which takes money from
                        your
                        biweekly pay and puts it into the investments you’ve selected. Even if you don’t have a 401(k),
                        many
                        brokerage accounts allow you to set up automatic transfers to your account. Then you may be able
                        to set
                        up automatic investments at a broker or one of the best robo-advisors.

                        You can automate the process of investing, helping to keep your emotions out of the process.

                <h2 style="font-size: 40px; color: black; font-weight: 300;">How the stock market works</h2>
                <p>
                    The stock market is really a way for investors or brokers to exchange stocks for money, or vice versa.
                Anyone who wants to buy stock can go there and buy whatever is on offer from those who own the stock.
                Buyers are expecting their stocks to rise, while sellers may be expecting their stocks to fall or at
                least not rise much more.

                So the stock market allows investors to wager on the future of a company. In aggregate, investors set
                the value of the company by what price they’re willing to buy and sell at.

                While stock prices in the market on any day may fluctuate according to how many shares are demanded or
                supplied, over time the market evaluates a company on its business results and future prospects. A
                business growing sales and profits will likely see its stock rise, while a shrinking business will
                probably see its stock fall, at least over time. In the short term, however, the performance of a stock
                has a lot to do with just the supply and demand in the market.

                When private firms see which stocks investors favor, they may decide to fund their business by selling
                stock and raising cash. They’ll conduct an initial public offering, or IPO, using an investment bank,
                which sells shares to investors. Then investors can sell their stock later in the stock market if they
                want to or they can buy even more at any time the stock is publicly traded.

                The key point is this: investors price stocks according to their expectations of how the company’s
                business will perform in the future. So the market is forward-looking, with some experts saying the
                market anticipates events about six to nine months away.
                </p>
                

                <h2 style="font-size: 40px; color: black; font-weight: 300;">Risks and benefits of investing in stocks</h2>
                <p>
                    The stock market allows individual investors to own stakes in some of the world’s best companies, and
                that can be tremendously lucrative. In aggregate, stocks are a good long-term investment as long as
                they’re purchased at reasonable prices. For example, over time the S&P 500 has generated about a 10
                percent annual return, including a nice cash dividend, too.

                Investing in stocks also offers another nice tax advantage for long-term investors. As long as you don’t
                sell your stock, you won’t owe any tax on the gains. Only money that you receive, such as dividends,
                will be taxable. So you can hold your stock forever and never have to pay taxes on your gains.

                However, if you do realize a gain by selling the stock, you’ll owe capital gains taxes on it. How long
                you hold the stock will determine how it’s taxed. If you buy and sell the asset within a year, it will
                fall under short-term capital gains and will be taxed at your regular income tax rate. If you sell after
                you’ve held the asset a year, then you’ll pay the long-term capital gains rate, which is usually lower.
                If you record a loss, you can write that off your taxes or against your gains.

                While the market as a whole has performed well, many stocks in the market don’t perform well and may
                even go bankrupt. These stocks are eventually worth zero, and they’re a total loss. On the other hand,
                some stocks such as Amazon and Apple have continued to soar for years, earning investors hundreds of
                times their initial investment.

                So investors have two big ways to win in the stock market:

                Buy a stock fund based on an index, such as the S&P 500, and hold it to capture the index’s long-term
                return. However, its return can vary markedly, from down 30 percent in one year to up 30 percent in
                another. By buying an index fund, you’ll get the weighted average performance of the stocks in the
                index.
                Buy individual stocks and try to find the stocks that will outperform the average. However, this
                approach takes a tremendous amount of skill and knowledge, and it’s more risky than simply buying an
                index fund. However, if you can find an Apple or Amazon on the way up, your returns are likely going to
                be much higher than in an index fund.
                </p>
                
                <h2 style="font-size: 40px; color: black; font-weight: 300;">Bottom line</h2>
                <p>
                    Investing in the stock market can be very rewarding, especially if you avoid some of the pitfalls that
                most new investors experience when starting out. Beginners should find an investing plan that works for
                them and stick to it through the good times and bad.
