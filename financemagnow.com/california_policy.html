        <h4>Editorial Policy</h4>

        <span class="imp">Updated Feb 6, 2023</span>

        <p class="main">
            Our mission is to simplify complex financial information and decisions so that our readers have the
            confidence
            to manage every aspect of their financial life. Your financial life is filled with personal decisions and
            challenges. Whether you are investing as a beginner or expert, planning your retirement, buying a home,
            studying
            for an exam in business school, or running a small business you have questions that need answering.

            For over 20 years, we’ve helped hundreds of millions of people do just that. We feel it’s important to share
            how
            we go about writing all of the articles that you depend on.

            At Financemagnow we aspire to provide the highest quality content produced by humans, for humans. It is
            against
            our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools
            such
            as ChatGPT.
        </p>

        <h4>Principles</h4>

        <p class="main">
            Empowering: Finance can be complex and intimidating. We provide you with information that you can use with
            confidence, whatever your level of experience.

            Unbiased: From financial product recommendations to the financial implications of government policy we put
            things in context and provide all the facts. Our information is carefully researched and is not written to
            support any specific economic or political viewpoint.

            Accurate: Having accurate financial information, presented clearly and updated regularly is of the utmost
            importance to us. We seek out and work with the most qualified experts across every topic we cover. Any
            mistakes, inaccuracies or misrepresentations identified by our readers are investigated and corrected
            promptly. Please contact us for corrections.

            Inclusive: We work to ensure that our content serves—and depicts with dignity and respect—people of
            different ages, nationalities, religions, gender identities, sexual orientations, ethnicities, relationship
            statuses, physical and mental abilities, and family types.
        </p>

        <h4>Ethics</h4>

        <p class="main">
            We are committed to following the Codes of Ethics of the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing
            (SABEW). Our content is guided by and upholds the Society for Professional Journalists’ foundations of
            ethical journalism: being accurate and fair, minimizing harm, acting independently, and being accountable
            and transparent. We also uphold the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines on disclosures, where
            applicable.

            Financemagnow content is for informational purposes and is not intended to substitute for the advice of a
            licensed or certified attorney, accountant, financial advisor, or other certified financial professionals.
        </p>
        <h4>Editorial Process</h4>

        <p class="main">
            Our staff of editors and network of expert contributors write and manage all the articles you find on
            Financemagnow. We don’t make recommendations for you to buy, sell, or hold securities or investments. We do,
            however, provide relevant analysis, context, insights, and educational information to help you make smarter,
            better-informed decisions. Wherever possible we provide examples that help put complex topics and concepts
            into
            perspective.

            Our editorial team is continually evaluating the articles across our site to flag any that contain
            information
            that is known to be or is likely to be out-of-date. Such articles are reviewed and updated or, if necessary,
            completely rewritten, rechecked, and re-edited. Our network of experienced experts, who uphold our process
            and
            policies, assist with our updating efforts. Articles that have been updated are date-stamped to reflect
            this.
        </p>
        <h4>Quality Standards</h4>

        <p class="main">
            Every article you see has multiple people behind it, continually working to make sure that it is
            responsible,
            accurate, understandable, helpful, and reflective of our editorial principles.

            Our editorial team approves all story ideas independently, and our expert contributors each have deep
            subject
            matter expertise in the topics that we assign them. Our team of professional editors, fact checkers, and
            producers review content to ensure it upholds our values of being empowering, inclusive, unbiased, and
            accurate.

            All staff are responsible for disclosing any potential conflicts of interest.
        </p>
        <h4>Corrections</h4>

        <p class="main">
            Financemagnow is committed to telling readers when an error has appeared, and to correcting it. This
            transparency applies to small and large mistakes, including news, but only if an error was made at the time
            of
            original publication. Corrections will be clearly noted on the page. When our journalism is factually
            correct,
            but the language is not as clear or detailed as necessary, the story may be updated without an editor's
            note.
            Please report possible errors to inv_editorial@Financemagnow.com.
        </p>
        <h4>Writers</h4>

        <p class="main">
            Financemagnow experts are carefully recruited, vetted, and chosen. Some are experienced financial writers,
            others are experts in particular aspects of finance; many are both. They are selected for their knowledge
            and
            their skill at communicating complex topics in clear, accessible, actionable language.

            Every article’s author or reviewer is listed at the top of the page, to the left of the date, and is linked
            to
            their biography, which you can click on to learn more about their credentials, education, professional
            experience, and social media presence.

            All writers are required to uphold the editorial guidelines listed above.
        </p>
        <h4>Third-Party Content</h4>

        <p class="main">
            Third-party content is carefully reviewed by the Financemagnow editorial team to ensure that it is aligned
            with
            our policies and standards. Any such content is labeled clearly and conspicuously to notify you of its
            source.

        <h4>Advertising Disclosure</h4>
        <span class="imp"> Updated June 12, 2020</span>
        <p class="main">
            Financemagnow accepts advertising, but maintains a strict and clear separation between advertising and
            editorial
            content. Special attention is paid to featuring advertising in a way that will not interfere with your
            reading
            experience. This relates to both page design and to the number of ads we choose to feature on a page.

            Financemagnow maintains a distinct separation between advertising and editorial content.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All advertising or sponsored content on Financemagnow is clearly and unambiguously distinguished from
                editorial content through borders or other distinguishing elements and/or identified as an "Ad,"
                "Advertisement," "Sponsored" or a similar designation indicating that the content is being provided by
                or on behalf of the sponsor.</li>
            <li>All ads on Financemagnow are labeled as an "Ad," "Advertisement," "Sponsored" or a similar designation
                indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of the sponsor.</li>
            <li>All "native" ads or paid content are identified as an "Ad," "Advertisement," "Sponsored" or a similar
                designation indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of the sponsor.</li>
            <li>Editorial content on Financemagnow is not influenced by advertisements unless the content is sponsored
                content, in which case, the content will be clearly demarcated and identified with the title "Ad,"
                "Advertisement," or "Sponsored", or a similar designation, indicating that the content is being provided
                by or on behalf of an advertiser or sponsor.</li>
            <li>In some cases, editorial may include links to partners for which Financemagnow receives an affiliate
                commission (See ‘How We Make Money’ for more details). The placement of these links is not influenced by
                payment, and editorial reserves the right to change, modify or remove them at any time in order to
                provide the best experience to users.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How We Make Money</h4>

        <p class="main">
            The way that we're able to offer over 30,000 articles of great content on our website for free is by
            partnering
            with advertisers and affiliate partners who are looking to reach consumers. This can take a number of
            different
            forms, and we'll walk through those below. It's important to note that we maintain strict editorial
            independence
            for all of our content, particularly on reviews and recommendations. If a product is great, we'll tell you
            even
            if we don't have an advertising relationship. If we think a product is bad, we'll tell you that, even if we
            DO
            have an advertising relationship with them. While we do recommend and review products regardless of any
            advertising relationships, we may not have reviewed every product available in a given category.
        </p>
        <h4>Affiliate Links to Advertisers</h4>

        <p class="main">
            In some cases we may have an affiliate relationship with a product that we review, and so when you click on
            an
            "Open Account" button or sometimes a hyperlink on the product's name in those cases we may receive
            compensation
            either when you click on it it or if you decide to sign up for the product. Whether or not we have an
            advertiser
            in place does not change the placement of the button or whether there's a link for you to go to their
            website.
            Example of a broker review
            Example of a broker review with a product card featuring an Open Account button, for which we may receive
            compensation when you click it or if you sign up for the product.
        </p>

        <h4>Comparison/Rate Tables Featuring Advertisers</h4>

        <p class="main">
            On some review/recommendations we may include a comparison table of products that are offers from
            advertisers.
            While we do work hard with partners to try and surface the best paid offers possible in these comparison
            tables,
            it's important to note that they are NOT editorially selected. Here's an example of what that can look like,
            notice the Advertising Disclosure link in the top right corner:

        <p class="main">
            We may collect information, including personal data, directly from you if you choose to provide that

            captured

            information about your visit using tools such as cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies. The

            device
            you use to access the Site, unique device identifiers, clickstream data (which shows the page-by-page path

            take as you browse the Site). We or our third-party partners may combine information that each of us

            To manage our automatic data collection, we may place tags (often referred to as “web beacons”) on pages on
            the
            Site or in emails we send to you. Web beacons are small files that link web pages to particular web servers
            and
            their cookies, and they may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to
            the
            Site, analyzing how users navigate around the Site, assessing how many emails that we send are actually
            opened
            and which articles or links are viewed by visitors.

            We also use third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, on the Site, to provide us with
            statistics and other information about visitors to the Site.

        <p style="padding-left: 95px; padding-right: 95px;">
            <b>“Do Not Track” Signals.</b> Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not

            interactions with these features. This information collection is subject to the privacy policies or notices
            of

        <p class="main">
            Our agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers may have access to information we collect
            through
            the Site to carry out work on our behalf. Those parties are subject to confidentiality obligations and are
            restricted from using personal data collected through the Site for purposes other than to provide the
            requested
            assistance. In addition, we may share information:

            With our affiliates for internal business purposes;
            With third parties for marketing purposes, including social media networks, data management platforms, and
            other
            advertising technology providers; for example, we may match your email address with third parties with whom
            you
            have also consented to share your email address and use such match to deliver custom offers or emails to you
            on
            the Sites and elsewhere online;
            If we are required to do so by law, regulation, or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena);
            In response to requests from government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, including to meet
            national security requirements;
            If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in
            connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity;
            With respect to analytics and statistical information, to inform advertisers about the nature of our user
            base;
            In the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including a reorganization,
            dissolution, or liquidation). In such an event, we will seek to provide you with commercially reasonable
            notice,
            e.g., via email and/or notice on our website, of any change in ownership, incompatible new uses of your
            personal
            information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information; and
            With your consent or at your discretion.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Retention and Access</h4>

        <p class="main">
            We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes it was retained, such as to
            enable you to use the Website and your products or to provide services to you. In some instances, we may
            retain
            data for longer periods in order to comply with applicable laws (including those regarding document

            Under certain circumstances we will not be able to fulfill your request, such as if it interferes with our
            regulatory obligations, affects legal matters, we cannot verify your identity, or it involves
            disproportionate
            cost or effort, but in any event we will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and provide
            you
            an explanation. In order to make such a request of us, please email us at privacy@Financemagnow.com.
